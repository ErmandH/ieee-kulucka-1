                    KD6-3.7, nicknamed K and later known as Joe, was a Nexus-9 replicant Blade Runner tasked by the Los Angeles Police Department with retiring outdated Nexus-8 replicants, which were rushed into production in 2020 by the Tyrell Corporation upon the death of its founder, Dr. Eldon Tyrell, in 2019. A number of the remaining Nexus-8 models had formed a replicant freedom movement, which the LAPD sought to terminate as well.
                    On June 30, 2049, following his retirement of fugitive replicant Sapper Morton, K's superior in the LAPD, Lieutenant Joshi, tasked him with terminating the child of a female replicant whose remains were unearthed from beneath Sapper's tree.
                    A Nexus-9 replicant model, Officer K was inherently obedient and devoted in his duty as a member of law enforcement in Los Angeles. He was predisposed to be truthful and loyal to his superiors.
                    Despite his cool and collected demeanor, K could and would demonstrate that he was an experienced, hardened police officer capable of turning aggressive and contentious.
                    K's investigation pushed him to the limits, both emotionally and physically, yet ultimately he chose to act selflessly and courageously as he rescued Deckard from the Wallace Corporation.

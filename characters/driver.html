					The Driver is a stuntman and mechanic by day, but at night, he works as an independent getaway driver for criminals. His name and past is unknown, but its shown that he is a perfectionist at what he does, as skilled as he is a force to reckon with. He is a no-nonsense individual, talented at getting to the point of a situation to avoid any interfering delays. Eventually, he meets his neighbor, Irene, whom he falls in love with, and her husband, who owes money to local gangsters.

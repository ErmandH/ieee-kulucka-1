					Tyler Durden is the Narrator’s imaginary alter ego, the embodiment of his “death drive” and repressed masculinity. In many ways, though, Tyler is more “real” than the Narrator himself, as suggested by the fact that he has a name and the Narrator does not. Tyler is charismatic, cunning, and ambitious, and when “the Narrator” (speaking as Tyler Durden) speaks to the members of fight club, they respect him enormously; indeed, they refer to the Narrator as “Mr. Durden” (since, from their perspective, the Narrator and Tyler are one and the same). Tyler’s lack of inhibition and his desire to be “real” leads him to embrace pain and danger at all times. Eventually, Tyler becomes more powerful than the Narrator, to the point where he takes control of the Narrator’s body for most of the time (when the Narrator is supposedly sleeping), and sends members of fight club and Project Mayhem on increasingly dangerous and destructive missions. In the end, the Narrator seems to “defeat” Tyler by shooting himself in the head—suggesting that the Narrator has embraced his “death drive” and perhaps become one with Tyler.

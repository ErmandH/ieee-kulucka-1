					Patrick Bateman is the novel’s protagonist and narrator. He is a 27-year-old Harvard graduate who now lives in New York City and works on Wall Street as an investment banker. He religiously watches “The Patty Winters Show” and idolizes Donald Trump. He is meticulous about his cleanliness and health – his morning routine boasts an impressive array of exercises and beauty products – and he is interested in nothing but the finest, most expensive things – from shoes, to dining experiences, to women and friends. Patrick Bateman is also a serial rapist and murderer. He is a man filled not only with anger but also with the sadistic desire to enact his most violent and twisted fantasies on other people, especially on those whose lives he does not see as having value, like prostitutes and the homeless. Throughout the course of the novel, he takes the reader through the events of his life and into the darkest parts of his mind, and as his addictions to drugs, sex, and violence grow, the reader follows Bateman down a graphic spiral of torture, hallucination, and insanity.
